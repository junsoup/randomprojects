Displays the currently playing spotify song as a status message in the league client's status bar.
It also downsamples the song's cover image into a 16x8 (i know it's horrible) and using full-width hash characters to draw the pixel.
It works! (if you can say a 16x8 pixel image is working).
I found it to look better without the art so I just removed it.
Also refer to the other league status related scripts I wrote for some more info.
