You know that one project that you always wanted to make? yeah that one! well, this is it, except this is the 4th rendition of it!

This is for making a space-themed game.

However, it turns out solo game-dev without using external libraries (other than for rendering) is difficult!

This is the fourth rendition/refactor of my starting work. I need to create a roadmap for this project. This is all client-side which is the problem. There is no meaning in creating anything currently since it will need to be deleted for a server-setup.

I have a heidisql database setup for the login. Of which I don't even know how refactorable that is.
