Collection of random league client related scripts.

The bulk of the scripts, ("complete scripts"), is to create an active status message system.
Through testing, I found there was a limit to how frequently you could update your league status (~5 seconds for short messages)
(~60 seconds for paragraphs)
I also found there can be de-syncing of client and server when running for a long time. (cause unknown). 

karth is for explicitly solving list of item combinations for maximizing ability haste given a specific amount of gold for a game.
It becomes practically impossible to solve it out by hand since items have unique purchasing rules.
Also, it runs fairly slow. However, that is to be expected since the feature space would be around 18564 (13c6)?
