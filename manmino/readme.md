js script to read a chinese character, perform necessary lookup in csv, and print romanized form.

I created the lookup table separately, which was with the information of various combinations of character sound rules and categories.

I do not have much interest in chinese, but my older brother requested this script from me and it was a good chance for me to practice js with csv manipulation.
