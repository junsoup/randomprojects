A crazy dumb project for when I was obsessed with card counting / probabilities for blackjack.

I wrote two programs, 

First, main.py for calculating the theoretical chance for the dealer to bust by exhausive calculation.
Spoiler alert:
I would need a super computer given more than 5ish decks.
Honestly though, the logic for calculating this was incredibly complex and difficult so I'm keeping it.

The second program is counting.py. This was for card counting, which is finding an abnormally skewed conditions of card randomness, such that the player has a better chance to win. This is just counting the value of cards so this was much quicker to create.
